# Blue Sky Bank 



Blue Sky Bank is a simple command line banking application built with Python.
It lets customers create accounts, log in, and manage their money through a text-based menu. 

# Technical Requirements

Customers can register as new users and open checking or savings accounts—or both. They log in with an ID and password, and once inside, they can only view their own accounts.

The withdrawal feature is fully implemented. Customers may withdraw money from either account, but never more than $100 in a single transaction. If a withdrawal causes the account to go negative, an overdraft fee of $35 is applied. After repeated overdrafts, the account is deactivated until enough funds are added to bring the balance back above zero.
